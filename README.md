## 🧠 Introduction

This project is a unified agri-support platform tailored for smallholder farmers, especially those with limited digital access. It enables farmers to receive crop-related insights, weather-based farming tips, irrigation and pesticide schedules, and direct access to a crop marketplace—either via a mobile app or an automated phone call service.

By making farming data and expert advice accessible to all, we aim to bridge the digital divide in agriculture and increase profitability for underserved rural communities.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in rural areas face multiple challenges:

- Lack of personalized crop advice and scientific farming knowledge.

- Dependence on middlemen, leading to reduced profits.

- No digital access or technical literacy, excluding them from agri-tech advancements.

- Ineligibility for credit, due to lack of formal transaction records or farm documentation.

These issues result in poor yields, financial instability, and minimal growth, keeping farmers locked in a cycle of low income and inefficiency.

## ✅ Solution Overview

Our platform provides a dual-access solution for farmers—via an Android app and a phone-based voice interface. Key features include:

- 📲 Farmer Registration: Captures key details like location, crops, and land size to tailor recommendations.

- 🌱 Crop & Process Recommendations: Uses ML to suggest best-fit crops and ideal sowing practices.

- 💧 Irrigation and Pesticide Scheduling: Offers dynamic alerts based on crop type, weather, and location.

- 🛒 Inbuilt Marketplace: Enables direct crop sales, bypassing middlemen.

- ☎ Phone Service for Non-Smartphone Users: Ensures inclusivity for digitally disconnected farmers.

- 📈 Data Generation for Credit Access: Transaction and farming data helps farmers build a credit profile for future financial inclusion.
